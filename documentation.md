## 1. Codebase Overview

A codebase!

As an expert software architect, my task is to analyze this entire codebase and provide a high-level summary of the project.

**Project Overview**

The project appears to be a tool for generating documentation and summaries from source code. It utilizes natural language processing (NLL) techniques to generate human-readable explanations of code changes. The tool is designed to work with various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Markdown.

**Key Features**

1. **Codebase Summary**: The project can generate a high-level summary of the entire codebase, providing an overview of the project's purpose, technologies used, and overall structure.
2. **Change Explanation**: The tool can explain individual changes made to specific files, providing context about the change, its purpose, and potential impact on the project.
3. **Ollama API Integration**: The project integrates with the Ollama API, a natural language processing platform, to generate human-readable explanations of code changes.

**Architecture**

The project's architecture appears to be modular, with several utilities providing functionality for:

1. **Config Handler**: Handles configuration files and default settings.
2. **Diff Utility**: Compares snapshots of file contents and identifies added, modified, or deleted files.
3. **LLM Utility**: Utilizes the Ollama API to generate summaries and explanations.
4. **DB Utility**: Manages database interactions for storing snapshot data.

**Key Components**

1. **Snapshots Directory**: Stores timestamped JSON files containing snapshots of file contents.
2. **Codebase Content**: A single string containing the content of all relevant files.

Overall, this project appears to be a promising tool for generating documentation and summaries from source code.
